For our senior capstone design project, we were given the liberty of choosing our own design. Our group chose to design and implement a Gauss Rifle, or Coilgun, which uses forces produced by electromagnetic coils to launch a ferromagnetic projectile. Using a National Instruments myRIO microcontroller and infrared sensors, ten stages of powerful electromagnetic coils were delivered 20A to send a ferromagnetic projectile down a 40-inch barrel. These coils were powered by a bank of large capacitors connected in parallel, totaling 150mF and charged to 50V. With five different printed circuit board designs and 14 boards in total, the Coilgun was able to shoot the projectile at 18m/s, punching holes in cardboard boxes at a distance of over 15 feet. The project drew upon our knowledge of microcontroller programming, circuit design and analysis, circuit board design, and electromagnetic fields, spanning the entire curriculum of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

The group consisted of Michael Eller, Brendon Koch, Evan Lendermon, Noah Sauber, and myself. Our technical advisor was Professor Harry Powell, a professor of electrical engineering in the ECE Department.
