The objective of the project was to design, build, and test an operational amplifier. The final design was implemented using 16 bipolar-junction transistors and an assortment of resistors and capacitors. The goal was to build a stage that had a low output impedance to drive a small load, such as an 8Ω speaker and high input impedance. In addition to impedances, the assignment specified a high open-loop gain and a feedback loop to control the gain easily. Lastly, it was necessary to have a high bandwidth and large phase margin. A correctly designed operational amplifier fulfills all of these requirements and the implemented amplifier meets most of the specifications. After the final implementation was constructed in hardware on a breadboard, it was tested with signals from a function generator with an 8Ω speaker and proved success.
