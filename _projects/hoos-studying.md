Hoo's Studying is an application that allows college students at the University of Virginia to quickly and efficiently create study groups on the fly for their classes. This will help students find study partners that they normally wouldn't work with, or know, otherwise. The goal of Hoo's Studying is to make it easier and more convenient for UVA students to work together and do well in their courses.

The project is no longer in development; at the beginning of my third-year, engineering got pretty busy and I wasn't able to put the finishing UX touches on it to get it to launch. I had a great time with the project and my goal is to pass it along to an underclassman before I graduate so that they can work with it and get it out there.

In addition to creating a tool for our peers to use, another goal of Hoo's Studying is for the developers to learn new skills. So far, I've learned how to setup and maintain a Linux server (Ubuntu Server 15.04) on a cloud machine through Digital Ocean for web hosting and testing. Futhermore, I've learned the majority of my web development knowledge (PHP, Javascript/JQuery, HTML, Twitter Bootstrap, HTML, CSS) and Git skills through this project by just jumping in and learning as I go.
