The focus of Software Development Methods (CS 2110) was to get aquainted with Android development and the process of creating software. As a final project, teams were given the opportunity to create a game that was optimized for the Nexus 7 tablet on Kit Kat (Android 4.4, API 19). Ghost Hunter is a game where the player must kill all the ghosts on the screen using various weapons. Although very simple, the app was developed from scratch by myself and three other UVA students in the Fall of 2014. We never got around to posting the game to the Android Play Store, but you can fork our GitHub repository below to check it out.
