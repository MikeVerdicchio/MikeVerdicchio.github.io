At the end of Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering III (ECE 3750), we built EKGs in an effort to test our ability to design Sallen-Key lowpass filters with a specific cutoff frequency, design printed circuit boards in Ultiboard, and build/solder them. The EKG would take very small voltage differences between the probes on the body and amplify them to a much larger signal. Then, the noise in the signal was filtered out and the final signals were able to be measured using a VirtualBench or myRIO/Launchpad.

After finishing the boards, we tested them by connecting the probes to a test subject (below) and monitoring the signals with a Native Instruments myRIO and running digital signal processing (DSP) scripts.
