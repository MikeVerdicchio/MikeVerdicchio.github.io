SafeCollab was a project for Advanced Software Development (CS3240). The application is a web-based report system. Reports can be uploaded, encrypted, organized, and shared in the application. Messages (both public and private) can be sent between users for maximum communication on reports. Written in Python using Django, SafeCollab is currently hosted on Heroku at the link below.

The project focused on the software development cycle and group development. Tools such as Pivotal Tracker and Git (GitHub) were required for the project to keep the 'customer' (Teacher's Assistant) in the loop, much like a real project.
