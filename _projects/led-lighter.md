At the end of Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering II (ECE 2660), we were given a project to introduce us to printed circuit boards (PCBs), soldering, and designing filters. In groups of three, the goal of this assignment was to implement and build a system that would flash LEDs with the high and low frequencies of music. This assignment reinforced Sallen-Key filters and how they worked, while also reviewing the topic of operational amplifiers. A skeleton was provided for the circuit, and it was designed in National Instruments Ultiboard and then sent to be printed. Then, values of the various components (resistors and capacitors) of the skeleton were chosen after calculations and testing. The PCB was then soldered with these parts and the overall system was tested for functionability.

The system works flawlessly and is actually pretty cool! The red LED flashes with the low-frequencies (bass) and the green LED flashes with the high-frequencies (treble).
