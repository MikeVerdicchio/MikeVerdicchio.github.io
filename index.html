                Hi! I'm Mike Verdicchio, a software engineer at <a href="https://www.paribus.co">Paribus</a> by Capital One
                in New York City. I'm from Montpelier, Virginia, which is a few miles west of Richmond. I graduated
                from the University of Virginia, earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering in the School of
                Engineering & Applied Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                First and foremost, I'm an extreme geek. I love cracking terrible jokes, watching Netflix, and being
                outside. Whether it's shooting hoops, throwing the Frisbee, or kicking back in the sun with some
                headphones in, I'm at peace. I also love playing video games or watching sitcoms. I'm go-to tech
                support for my family and friends and am often finding myself fixing a smartphone or explaining why
                their computer won't turn on. I love anything with a circuit board in it and am passionate about
                entrepreneurship, empowering peers, and a long life of education. I'm a firm believer in the UVA
                mentality of a Jeffersonian Engineer: one that can do great engineering work, but also understand the
                societal impacts of their designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the far future, I see myself as a technology pioneer. Being an engineer, my end goal is to design
                things that excite people in this world. I'm interested in being a part of developing the circuitry and
                controls behind cutting-edge electronics that bring new and improved ways of living our lives, such as
                artificially intelligent robots, engine controllers, and audio electronics. For this reason, I see a
                graduate degree in my future, either in engineering or business. I'm also very interested in Patent and
                Intellectual Property Law and hope to one day incorporate that into my career.

                Along the way, I've picked up several programming languages and frameworks and used far too many
                software packages.
