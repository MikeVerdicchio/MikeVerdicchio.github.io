As a part-time job when not in class, I worked in the Student Activities Center (SAC) at UVA. The SAC is a central hub for over 600 Contracted Independent Organizations (CIOs) to meet and plan events, offering printing services and equipment rentals. The center helps CIOs flourish by giving them the opportunity to reach out to many students at the university. Furthermore, it offers them materials that they normally would not have access to or funds for.

I began working in the SAC as a second-year to get more involved in the University and make some money on the side. After a year of working as an Assistant, I knew I wanted a bigger role with more responsibility, so I applied to be the Equipment Manager for my third-year, and again for my last year at UVA. As the Equipment Manager, my goal was to maintain the equipment that these CIOs use and make sure it's working properly. In addition, I educated my coworkers and CIOs on the equipment available and acted as a resource to them. The SAC has dozens of pieces of equipment, ranging from cords and adapters to sound systems and projects, totaling over $15,000. Therefore, it's important that I kept it in usable shape and ensured I know of its location at all times.
