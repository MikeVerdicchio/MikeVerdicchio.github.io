During the summer after my third-year at UVA, I interned in Indianapolis, Indiana with Rolls-Royce in their aerospace division. I worked in the Engineering Improvement Center, a part of their Engineering Capability department.

My main project was focused on web development (ASP.NET with C#) to enhance an application used for future cost analysis in projects. I attended meetings multiple times per week with my "customer" where we discussed features/changes that they would like to see in the application. I then implemented those features and tested them before I sent them to a pre-production server for testing by the customer. When they were happy, I deployed to the production server for over 750+ users around the globe.

My secondary project involved working with a Design Automation Engineer to help automate engine component design in Siemens NX.
