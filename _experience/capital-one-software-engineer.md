My current adventure is [Capital One Shopping](https://capitaloneshopping.com/) in New York City. Capital One Shopping's core product is a browser extenstion that tags along with you as you shop online, automatically applying the latest and best coupons to your order and letting you know if we've found a lower price elsewhere. We also offer Paribus, a service that monitors online purchases from your mailbox (email) for price drops, and automatically files claims for you within the window of the retailer's price protection policy. I currently work on the team that develops our Node.js-based email and placements platform.
