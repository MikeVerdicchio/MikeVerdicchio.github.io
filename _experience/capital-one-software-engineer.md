My current adventure is at Capital One in NYC, working on [Wikibuy](https://www.wikibuy.com) and [Paribus](https://www.paribus.co). Wikibuy has a browser extenstion that tags along with you as you shop online, automatically applying the latest and best coupons to your order and letting you know if we've found a lower price elsewhere. Paribus is a service that monitors online purchases from your mailbox (email) for price drops, and automatically files claims for you within the window of their price protection policy. I work on the backend team, developing on our Node.js-based email platform.

More to come!
