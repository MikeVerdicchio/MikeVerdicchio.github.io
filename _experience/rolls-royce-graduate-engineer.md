At Rolls-Royce, I'm in the Engineering Graduate Development Program, which is a rotational engineering leadership program that combines the three stages of the Rolls-Royce life-cycle: Define (requirements), Make (product), and Verify (solution) to build well-rounded engineers that understand the holistic view of the design process.

My first rotation was developing embedded software in LibertyWorks, Rolls-Royce's next-generation Defense R&D division. There, I wrote embedded modules for a TI microcontroller-based generator control unit running TI-RTOS to communicate with non-volatile memory. I also supported software development for the controls of an integrated power and thermal management system, created tools for rapid development and built code for a proprietary controller.

My second rotation was in Engine Performance, where I supported the methods team for future engine applications. I developed a Level 2 S-Function for Simulink to allow engine models to be run though the industry simulation tool in real time. I also created a multiprocessing script that distributes the simulations of large simulation experiments (1000+ points) across 16-cores. My final project was to design a demonstration database to better track performance work in the team.

Next, I went on to do project management and business development for an IoT technology demonstrator.

My final role at Rolls-Royce was in the Controls team, working on cybersecurity enhancements for an engine controller demonstrator.
