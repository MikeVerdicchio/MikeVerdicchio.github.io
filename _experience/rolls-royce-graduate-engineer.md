After graduating from UVA, I moved to Indianapolis, Indiana to join Rolls-Royce in the Engineering Graduate Development Program (GDP). The GDP is a rotational engineering leadership program that combines the three stages of the engineering lifecycle: Define (requirements), Make (product), and Verify (solution) to build well-rounded engineers that understand the holistic view of the engineering process. Over my two years in the program, I worked with five different teams.

My first rotation was an Embedded Software Engineer in LibertyWorks, Rolls-Royce's next-generation Defense R&D division. There, I wrote embedded modules for a TI microcontroller-based generator control unit running TI-RTOS to communicate with non-volatile memory. I also supported software development for the control logic of an integrated power and thermal management system, created tools for rapid development, and built code for a proprietary controller.

My second rotation was as an Application Software Engineer in Engine Performance, where I supported future engine applications. I developed tools for aerospace engineers to aid in their model creation, such as a Level 2 S-Function for Simulink to allow engine models to be run though the industry simulation tool in real-time. I also created a multiprocessing utility in Python that distributes the simulations of large experiments (1000+ points) across a 16-core system. My final project was to design a demonstration database to better track performance work in the team, which I did using Django and MySQL.

Next, I took a very non-traditional path for engineers in the program and switched to a project management role. Using systems design tools and robust engineering methods, I was able to capture requirements from stakeholders across the business to solve an internal problem. I worked with a local Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity startup out of Purdue University to design a custom tech demonstrator of our system. I managed a $100k+ budget and pitched the project at the Rolls-Royce Big Ideas Forum, an internal pitch competition for new product ideas, where I won the Judge's Choice Award.

My next role was in a group with two other Engineering GDP engineers in our Design/Make rotation, where we were tasked with designing and building a solution to a company problem (internal or external). Again, I took the non-traditional route and worked on a demonstrator for expanding Rolls-Royce's cloud computing presence. Similar to the IoT project, my group managed a budget, stakeholder requirements, and a relationship with a local MSaaS company to create a demonstrator to pitch to executive leadership. We also devoloped analytic algorithms designed to run on Google Cloud Platform to track deterioration of M250 helicopter engines.

My final role at Rolls-Royce was in the Controls team, working on cybersecurity firmware enhancements for an engine controller demonstrator. I worked on implementing Trusted Platform Module (TPM) functionality for cybersecurity of a TI microcontroller-based control system. I also got to work at the hardware level by designing a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) memory interface in a cybersecurity tech demo. This role ended when I left Rolls-Royce in April, 2019.
