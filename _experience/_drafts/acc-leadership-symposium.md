The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Leadership Symposium brings together representatives from all 15 universities in the ACC for leadership development. The year I attended, the conference was hosted at Clemson University in South Carolina. The three day (weekend-long) conference focused on student activism and involved speakers and discussion on the topic and how it can be related to social justice.

The topic that my group (composing of students from nine different universities) was gentrification in cities and on college campuses. Below is a copy of the presentation, which focuses on the background and implications of the issue as well as offers a policy-based solution.
