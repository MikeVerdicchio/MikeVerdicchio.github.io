Leadership on the Lawn in an annual leadership conference at the University of Virginia for rising juniors and seniors in high school from all around the country (and even the globe). The goal of this very competitive conference is to teach young leaders what it takes to become the change they want to see in their high schools and communities.

In the summer of 2015, I was lucky enough to be a counselor for the program. My group of eight students and I spent the day together attending presentations, lectures, and other activities to better their leadership skills, and mine as well. After a long day of learning, we would debrief and discuss what we learned and what we thought about the process. The counselors were meant to be facilitators and to leave the discussion to the students. At night, we had various activities planned to allow for some fun, like a UVA scavenger hunt, field day, and a talent show. By the end of the week, all the students had a much more diverse way of thinking about leadership and had met so many new friends along the way. Overall, I had a fantastic time as a counselor, and learned so much from not only the presenters, but the students as well. Each of them had their own story and experiences to share which were unique from any others.

The main topics that were covered during the conference were Leadership Development, Self-Discovery, Goal Making, Service, Multiculturalism and Diversity, Mindbugs, and Negotiation.
