Madison House is a student volunteering organization at the University of Virginia that brings together over 3,000 UVA students weekly to volunteer in the Charlottesville community. I've been volunteering at Madison House since my second semester and I absolutely love it. It gives me an opportunity to give back to the community while also exploring new areas of the town.

The program that drew me to Madison House my first-year (2014) was Housing Improvement. Each Friday afternoon, I would go to the Habitat Store and build, paint, and organize donated furniture and home improvement supplies. These goods are then sold at low prices for revenue to help fund Habitat for Humanity projects in the area. I participated in this program for two more semesters following the first.

The program that I was most involved with my third and fourth-years at UVA was Athletics. My friends and I coached a U10/U12 soccer team with the Soccer Organization of Charlottesville Area (SOCA). We had hour-long midweek practices and then games on Saturday. This was one of my favorite experiences at UVA because I got the opportunity to work with kids and teach them a skill they enjoy.
