After my second year at UVA, I did research in the Department of Computer Science at UVA under Professor David Evans. I worked alongside four other students to create educational material dedicated to teaching computer security fundamentals to the general public and developers. The topics we studied for general users includes passwords, two-factor authentication, bitcoin, and more. For developers, we look into SQL injections, password hashing, cross-site scripting (XSS) and other hacking techniques. All of our videos, info-graphics, and descriptive pages are located on our website.
